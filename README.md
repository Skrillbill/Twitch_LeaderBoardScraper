# Twitch Leaderboard Scraper
### Version 2.0.1

## Uses:
For archival uses. Tool will open the configured twitch channels' chat in a browser window, expands the <br>
leaderboards for both Bits and Gifts/gifted subs and takes a screenshot of each. Does not use the Twitch API <br> 
in any way. Instead we use the Chromedriver library (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/). 

## Features: 
1. Automatic updates
2. User configurable options
3. Writen in python with standalone exe for ease of use


## How to use it
1. Download the ***TwitchBitScraper_v2.0.1.zip*** from Releases. <br>
2. Unzip to desired location(it is recommended to override existing version of conifg.ini in this release due to additional options being added). 
3. Add your desired twitch stream to the *TWITCH_SETTINGS* section of the conifg.ini file. <br> (example: https://www.twitch.tv/popout/yourchannelhere/chat)
4. Change *output_dir* under *SCRAPER_SETTINGS* (make sure to put a \ at the end of your path!)
5. (Optional) Change show_popup to True in config.ini if you wish to see a popup each time tool is run.
